# Project 2 - Testing Solution Quality

## Overview

Project 2 involves testing various bin packing algorithms experimentally to determine the quality of the solutions they produce. Specific bin-packing algorithms to be implemeted and tested are the following five algorithms:

1. Next Fit (NF)

2. First Fit (FF)

3. First Fit Decreasing (FFD)

4. Best Fit (BF)

5. Best Fit Decreasing (BFD)

**NOTE**: Algorithms above except Next Fit algorithm have two implementations. The naive version has time complexity O(N^2). The faster implementation version uses balanced binary search tree (E.g. AVL Tree) ans has time complexity O(N logN).
